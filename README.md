# Task 5
This repository includes the four tasks I have done in phase 1 of the training and each task is in an individual branch inside its problems.
## Task 1
1.1 It is a small C program that prints "GRU" on the screen.

1.1_bonus It is a small C program that draws "GRU" with astreics on the screen.

1.2 It is a small C program that shows a counting down on the screen.

1.3 It is a task manager program which has written in C language.

1.4 It is a C program that gets 2 sensors' reading and make a fusion to get an output array with accurate readings.


## Task 2
2.1 A circuit simulated by proteus converts 220V AC to 5V to lighten LED safely by using a step-down transformer, diodes, filter and regulator.

2.2 H-bridge simulated by proteus to control the direction of a DC motor.

2.3 Report about how many batteries we need to lighten an LED for more than 5 hours.

BMS.pdf It is a PDF about the types of BMS and how it works.

## Task 3
3.1 An Arduino codes for master and slave for transferring data from the master to slave and makes an action according to the data we got with TinkerCad simulation link.

3.2 An Arduino code for make localization of the cookie-bot robot using 44 ultrasonic sensors with a PDF file about the SLAM and how it works.

## Task 4
4.1 It is a Python code for a game between Gru and Vector.

4.2 It is a Python code to apply the principle of machine learning on a given dataset.
